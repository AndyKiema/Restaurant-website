         <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quas voluptatem ex quidem! Accusamus dolor repellendus quos, labore molestiae nostrum? Commodi et autem natus inventore corporis! Maxime molestiae quas iusto animi.at Adam’s Arcade in Nairobi with a mission to introduce the gourmet coffee culture to Kenya. Starting as a cozy coffee shop, we soon evolved into an American diner-style restaurant. Today, Java House has blossomed into one of Africa’s leading coffee brands, with outlets in 14 cities across Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. We offer a unique and delightful 3-day part coffee-led, casual dining experience.What is exploratory testing? It’s a type of software testing that offers a hands-on approach to discovering the ins and outs of a platform. Today, I’ll be sharing my experience testing the HNG website, a tech outsourcing and training platform. You can explore the HNG website further here. Based on my findings after navigating through its features and functionalities, I uncovered several interesting bugs, usability issues, and inconsistencies, along with some suggestions for improvement!

            Before we dive in, let me introduce myself. Hi, I’m Mercy, a QA newbie and soon-to-be expert, participating in the HNG11 internship program. This is my first ever exploratory test and technical article, and I’m excited to share some of my findings and insights with you!</p>

         <p>Recommendations

            Reflections and Preferences
            As a newbie to exploratory testing and QA, this experience was enlightening. It showed how important thorough testing is for improving user experiences, and personally, I prefer a website that is visually appealing, very easy to navigate, and free from any technical glitches.</p>

         <p>I have concluded my exploratory testing on the Cars.ng website. In this blog, I will explain the issues I identified and provide recommendations to improve the website.

            Methodology
            Exploratory Testing is a software testing approach where testers actively explore the application, designing and executing tests on the fly to identify defects, usability issues, and unexpected behavior without following predefined test cases.
